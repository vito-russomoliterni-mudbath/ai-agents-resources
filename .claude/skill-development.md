# Skill Development Guide

## Reading Skills

When examining a skill:
1. Read `SKILL.md` for the complete workflow
2. Check `assets/` for templates and examples
3. Consult `references/` for detailed patterns and strategies

## Creating/Modifying Skills

When adding or updating skills:
1. Follow the established directory structure
2. Use consistent phase naming (Discovery, Implementation, Validation)
3. Include actionable, specific instructions
4. Provide templates in `assets/` when helpful
5. Create focused reference docs in `references/`
6. Keep the main SKILL.md workflow-focused
7. Move detailed patterns and examples to separate files

## Best Practices

- Keep SKILL.md focused on the workflow
- Use assets/ for templates and checklists
- Use references/ for deep-dive guidance
- Provide clear examples in assets/
- Make each reference file self-contained
- Use progressive disclosure principles
